# Overview  
Vero Mobile App is a comprehensive productivity and wellness application designed to help users manage their goals, track deep work sessions, and maintain healthy habits. The app combines goal management with time tracking and habit formation to create a holistic approach to personal productivity and mental well-being.

The app solves the problem of fragmented productivity tools by providing an integrated solution that combines:
- Goal setting and tracking with subgoals
- Deep work session management with timers
- Habit tracking and wellness check-ins
- Visual progress tracking through card-based interfaces

Target users are professionals, students, and anyone seeking to improve their productivity and maintain work-life balance through structured goal management and focused work sessions.

# Core Features

- **Goal Persistence**: Local storage for goal data persistence
- **Goal Reordering**: Drag-and-drop functionality for subgoal organization

## 2. Deep Work Timer System
- **Customizable Timer**: Set custom work session durations
- **Timer Controls**: Start, pause, and end session functionality
- **Visual Timer Display**: Real-time countdown with visual feedback
- **Session Tracking**: Track completed deep work sessions
- **Timer Persistence**: Save timer state across app sessions

## 3. Habit Tracking
- **Habit Tracker**: Track daily habits and routines
- **Progress Visualization**: Visual representation of habit completion
- **Streak Tracking**: Monitor consecutive days of habit completion
- **Habit Categories**: Organize habits by type (morning, evening, etc.)

## 4. Check-in System
- **Mood Check-ins**: Track emotional state and well-being
- **Progress Reviews**: Regular assessment of goal progress
- **Reflection Prompts**: Guided reflection on productivity and habits
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs showing trends over time

## 5. Navigation and UI
- **Bottom Navigation**: Easy access to main app sections

# User Experience  

## User Personas
1. **The Busy Professional**: Needs to manage multiple projects and maintain focus during work sessions
2. **The Student**: Wants to track study goals and maintain healthy study habits
3. **The Wellness Seeker**: Focuses on habit formation and mental well-being

## Key User Flows
1. **Goal Setting Flow**: Create new goal → Add subgoals → Set validation rules → Start tracking
2. **Deep Work Flow**: Select goal → Set timer → Start session → Complete session → Log progress
3. **Habit Tracking Flow**: View habits → Mark completion → Track streaks → Review progress
4. **Check-in Flow**: Open app → Complete mood check → Review goals → Update progress

## UI/UX Considerations
- **Card-based Design**: Intuitive swiping interface for goal management
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for completion states and progress
- **Accessibility**: Support for different screen sizes and accessibility features
- **Performance**: Smooth animations and responsive interactions
