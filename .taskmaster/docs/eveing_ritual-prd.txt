# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Vero App  
## Feature: Evening Ritual (Journaling Companion Flow)

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Evening Ritual** is a self-guided journaling screen users initiate intentionally from the “Rituals” section. It displays prompts to reflect on their day, anchored by a Time Timer to encourage focus. Users can explore context from their day via toggleable insight cards — including deep work summaries, task completions, and emotional check-ins. Vero acts only as a companion — it does not store journal entries in MVP.

---

## 🎯 Core Purpose

- Reinforce end-of-day mindfulness and journaling habits
- Help users review their day meaningfully
- Provide context to guide deeper, richer journaling
- Act as a lightweight ritual container (not a journaling capture app)

---

## ✨ Feature Highlights

### 1. Reflection Prompt Card (Default View)
- Shows all 4 default prompts at once
- Includes optional 5th prompt if mood/energy trend detected
- User writes in their **own journal**, not in-app

#### Default Prompts:
1. What am I grateful for today?
2. How can I improve?
3. What did I learn today?
4. Did I give my best today?

#### Optional Prompt:
- Based on mood/energy trends detected during the day
- Labeled: “From your day…”

### 2. Dynamic Insight Card Switching (Top Section)

#### Tapping any insight button updates the **top card**:

- 🧠 **Deep Work Trends**
  - Total deep work time
  - Session blocks or timeline view
  - Focus peak callouts

- ✅ **Tasks Accomplished**
  - List of completed tasks (grouped by goal if available)
  - Encouraging summary

- 💖 **Feeling Check-Ins**
  - Mood timeline (e.g. sparkline)
  - Emotional tags or word cloud
  - Micro-insight based on patterns

> Default state is the Reflection Prompts card.

---

### 3. Insight Buttons (Middle Strip)
- Located between the top card and timer
- Three side-by-side toggle buttons:
  - 🧠 Deep Work
  - ✅ Tasks Done
  - 💖 Feeling Check-Ins
- Highlighted state shows which card is active
- Deselecting reverts to prompt card

---

### 4. Time Timer (Bottom Section)
- Visual countdown (Time Timer style)
- Default duration: 5 minutes
- User can adjust with slider or digital crown
- Red wedge shrinks as time elapses
- Accompanied by prompt: “Take this time to journal your reflections.”

---

### 5. Completion Flow
- Button: **“I’m Done Journaling”**
- Triggers:
  - Shine animation (radial glow + affirmation)
  - Affirmation message (e.g., “You honored your thoughts today.”)
  - Post-Ritual Summary Card:
    - 🔥 Streak continuation status
    - 📊 Say/Do Ratio (based on day’s task/goal tracking)
    - Encouraging insight line

---

## 🧠 UX Interaction Model

- One screen, no navigation away
- Top card dynamically updates on button tap
- Bottom (insight buttons, timer, complete button) is static
- Smooth fade or slide animation between top cards

---

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- Platform: React Native (Expo SDK)
- Components:
  - `TopCardContainer` (switches between Prompt, Work, Tasks, Feelings)
  - `InsightButtonRow`
  - `TimeTimerCircle`
  - `CompleteRitualButton`
  - `ShineFeedback`
- State Management:
  - Active card (prompt/work/tasks/feelings)
  - Timer state and adjustment
  - Streak + Say/Do logic (backend-calculated or local model)

---

## 🔐 System Logging (MVP)

- Ritual start and end timestamps
- Active insight cards viewed
- Timer duration used
- Which optional prompt was shown
- Whether ritual was completed (for streak tracking)
- Say/Do ratio snapshot

> Note: No journal content is stored. User reflections are offline.

## 🚧 Development Phases

### MVP
- Default prompt card
- Time Timer

## 📌 Logical Build Order

1. Layout framework (TopCard + Static Bottom Section)
2. Prompt Card and Timer Circle
3. Insight toggle logic and state switching
4. Build each top card (Deep Work, Tasks, Feelings)
5. Completion and Shine logic
6. Summary Card component
7. Logging hooks

## 🎨 Design Guidance

- Theme: Calming, soft-close-of-day palette (`#121C2C → #2A3050`)
- Typography: Legible, soft sans-serif (e.g., SF Pro Rounded)
- Animations: Slow ripple, fade-in transitions
- Touch targets: 44pt minimum
- No input fields in MVP — focus is visual prompt and reflection
