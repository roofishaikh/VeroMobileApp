# Plan Feature PRD

## Overview
The Plan feature will replace the current DeepWorkScreen1 in the bottom navigation bar. Instead of directly showing the deep work screen, it will present users with a modal containing various planning and review options. This feature aims to help users better organize their time and maintain regular review cycles.

## User Interface

### Bottom Navigation Bar
- Replace current DeepWorkScreen1 with a new "Plan" icon
- Icon should be intuitive (e.g., calendar or clipboard icon)
- When tapped, opens a modal with planning options

### Plan Modal
The modal will display a grid of planning options, each with its own icon and description:

1. **Rise and Shine**
   - Icon: Sun or alarm clock

       - What is one thing I must accomplish today?
     - Timer functionality (5 or 10 minutes)

2. **Shutdown**
