# PRD: Weekly and Monthly Review Card Decks with Countdown Timers

## Overview

Implement advanced, self-swiping card decks for Weekly and Monthly Review screens in the app, each with a row of synchronized countdown timers and a fallback timer, providing a seamless and interactive journaling experience.

---

## Tasks

### 1. WeeklyReviewScreen.js: Multi-Card Deck with Questions

- Refactor the current card/question system to support a deck of 3 cards.
- Each card should render a unique set of 3-4 questions (sample questions can be generated by the developer; will be amended later).
- Cards should be visually distinct and easy to swipe.

### 2. Infinite Swipable Card Deck

- Implement infinite looping: swiping right/left on the first card brings up the second, swiping the second brings up the third, and swiping the third loops back to the first.
- Swiping should be smooth and support both user gestures and programmatic triggers.

### 3. Countdown Timer Row (WeeklyReviewScreen)

- 10px below the card deck, add a horizontal row of 3 countdown timers, each corresponding to a card.
- Each timer should have a variable duration (default: 4 seconds).
- Timers should be visually consistent and easy to distinguish.

### 4. Wire Timers to Cards (Auto-Swipe)

- When the first countdown timer elapses, the first card should swipe automatically to the second card.
- When the second timer elapses, the second card should swipe to the third.
- When the third timer elapses, the third card should swipe back to the first (infinite loop).
- Timers and cards must remain in sync, regardless of whether swiping is user-initiated or automatic.

### 5. Fallback Timer in Timer Row

- In the same row as the countdown timers, add a fallback timer displaying the remaining time in seconds.
- The fallback timer should be the same size as the other countdown timers and update in real time.

### 6. Preserve Existing TimeTimer Component

- Do not modify or interfere with the existing TimeTimer component or its logic.

### 7. MonthlyReviewScreen: 4-Card Deck and Timers

- In MonthlyReviewScreen, implement a similar card deck and timer row, but with 4 cards and 4 countdown timers.
- The infinite loop and auto-swipe logic should work identically, adapted for 4 cards/timers.
- Include a fallback timer as described above.

## Notes

- All UI/UX should be seamless and visually consistent with the app's design.
- Use placeholder/sample questions for now; these will be updated later.
- Ask for clarification if any requirements are ambiguous.
